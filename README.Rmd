This is a light version of the original package, [`menbayes`](https://github.com/dcgerard/menbayes), that only contains the likelihood ratio approaches. This is for easier maintenance and install. See the [`menbayes`](https://github.com/dcgerard/menbayes) package for the Bayesian tests.

Provides a suite of tests for segregation distortion in F1 polyploid populations (for now, just tetraploids). This is under different assumptions of meiosis. The main functions are:

- `multi_lrt()`: Run any of the likelihood ratio tests for segregation distortion in parallel across many SNPs.
- `multidog_to_g`: Format the genotyping output from `updog::multidog()` to be compatible withe input of `multi_lrt()`.
- `lrt_men_g4()`: Likelihood ratio test for segregation distortion using known genotypes.
- `lrt_men_gl4()`: Likelihood ratio test for segregation distortion using genotype likelihoods.
- `offspring_gf_2()`: Offspring genotype frequencies under the two parameter model of meiosis.
- `offspring_gf_3()`: Offspring genotype frequencies under the three parameter model of meiosis.
- `simf1g()`: Simulate genotypes from an F1 population of tetraploids.
- `simf1gl()`: Simulate genotype likelihoods from an F1 population of tetraploids.

We also provide some functions from competing methods, which we do not recommend using:

- `polymapr_test()`: Test from `polymapR`.
- `chisq_g4()`: Chi-squared test (not accounting for double reduction and preferential pairing) when genotypes are known.
- `chisq_gl4()`: Chi-squared test (not accounting for double reduction and preferential pairing) using genotype likelihoods.

Details of these methods may be found in Gerard et al. (2024).

Description: Provides tests for segregation distortion in F1 
    polyploid populations under different assumptions of meiosis. 
    These tests can account for double reduction, partial preferential pairing,
    and genotype uncertainty through the use of genotype likelihoods. 
    Parallelization support is provided. Details of these methods are 
    described in Gerard et al. (2025) <doi:10.1007/s00122-025-04816-z>.

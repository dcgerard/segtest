# segtest 2.0.0

* `seg_lrt()`: Tests for segregation distortion for arbitrary (even) ploidy F1 populations.
* `seg_multi()`: Runs `seg_lrt()` at many loci, with parallelization support from the future package.
* `gamfreq()`: Gamete frequencies under various models of meiosis.
* `gf_freq()`: Genotype frequencies of an F1 population under various models of meiosis.
* `drbounds()`: Two different upper bounds on the double reduction rates.
* `beta_bounds()`: Two different upper bounds on double reduction adjustment for simplex loci.
* `n_pp_mix()`: Number of mixing components in the pairing configuration model for partial preferential pairing.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
